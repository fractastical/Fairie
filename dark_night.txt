There is too much daylight beloved.
I long for the night. Where the sun
no longer demands bitter penance
and everything is still for a moment. 
One kiss and the world turns
just a little bit faster. 
Blow out the candle, close the shades,
let the night never end. Our embrace
is forever. We know only each other,
this enough for eternity. 
May our kisses burn so bright,
that the sun must yield to our brighter light,
and, seeing this fiery brillance,
delay its morning journey for shame.
How bright is the night! How delicate its slumber!
How great this eternal moment,
when time stands still, 
lovers, heroes are born,
timeless pillars from the running sands
of the day. Go not softly, but smelt the
running by your stillness. 
Go not quickly, but turn the whole world
into your caldron, bearing and
birthing children of light, 
knowing the dark fire
and the starry night.
