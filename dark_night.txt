There is too much daylight beloved.
I long for the night. Where the sun
no longer demands bitter penance
and everything is still, for a moment. 
One kiss and the world turns
just a little bit faster. 
Blow out the candle, close the shades,
let the night never end. Our embrace
is forever. We know only each other,
and this is enough for eternity. 
Let my kisses burn enough in your mouth,
that the sun must yield to our brighter light,
and, seeing our fiery brillance,
delay its morning journey for shame.
How bright is the night! How delicate its slumber!
How great the moment of the kiss,
when time stands still, 
and lovers and heroes are born,
as timeless pillars from the running sands
of the day. Go not softly, but smelt the
running by your stillness. 
Go not quickly, but turn the whole world
into your caldron, bearing and
birthing children of light, 
knowing the dark fire
and the starry night.
