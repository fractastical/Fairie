She spoke:

Child of the sun, why do you speak,
why do you run away, my hands long
to feel you, why do you shout,
why do you have so much to say?

And I was silent for a minute.
Night fell. 

What happened in the night?
I cannot remember. 
Some dreams lost
underneath the willow tree. 

Awakening and enwrapped,
speaking again and entwined,
and no longer struggling to free myself,
Accepting? No longer rejecting?

The days no longer seem so long
they are sweet, too sweet, 
empty and, yet, full of love,

Love?
Reach out before the last kiss
Rest in enfolding bosom
For today leaves on the wings of tomorrow

And touch dissolves to memory
And memory, is swept by time
Till feelings leave no echoing
And all the voice is gone

The discourse kills?
The touch gives life
and the touch deeper
the darker the night?
