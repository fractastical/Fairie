Dear mother, 

A fire burns within my heart that I must share with you, a fire that has consumed and is consuming me, that scars the night sky with its starry brilliance and leads all men for centuries to contemplate their fate in light of it. It is the problem of being and not-being, the possiblity of love and the mound of earthly inertia which attends and arrests each eager movement.
